# ProjetoIAA
Projeto final de IAA sobre CRISP DM and doen√ßas cardiovasculares


The objective of this project is to apply the CRISP-DM methodology to solve a cardiovascular diseases risk prediction problem, using Machine Learning methods.
To that end, a dataset based on information from United States Behavioral Risk Fac- tor Surveillance System1 should be used [Lupague et al., 2023]. This surveillance system conducts health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about 
U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.
